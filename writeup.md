We created 2 tables in our database: Users and Reservations. It is important that the tables containing all the users and reservations made are preserved even after the program closes as they will accessed again later on. In other words, users should be able to login without having to re-create their account and they must be allowed to pay or cancel their reservations even if they were booked in a previous session. As a result, users and reservations are stored in our database to be accessed globally. The Itineraries, however, only needs to be stored locally since it does not require a user to be logged in before searching for flights. When the program closes, the itineraries found during the session may be discarded, as they are only important during the current session when a logged in user wants to book a particular itinerary.
